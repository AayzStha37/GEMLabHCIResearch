[Speaker 2]
So, interview question participant number 7. So, you need to answer me depending on what you experienced after this experiment. This is a semi-structured open ended interview.

So, let us start. So, the different audio that you heard right in the game, how did it help you? What role did it play?

How was it important to you in the game, the different audio and different sounds that you heard?

[Speaker 1]
I think the most the same is the audio, I think. Because I need the sound to recognize where I am from and where I can walk. Because it is really close, I can make a little bit turn to the right way from the sound from.

Because if I cannot hear anything from the headphone, I cannot find the way.

[Speaker 2]
So, it helped you find direction and where to go?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, especially for the no version. Without any visuals. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
So, can you share the different kind of sounds that you found in the VR space, different kind of sounds?

[Speaker 1]
I mean from the floor or. Everything. Everything.

Yeah. Okay. So, such as the traffic lights.

Because I remember a question is far away and closer way to find two different traffic lights, right? How should I find it? I need to just move a little bit and to recognize where is the traffic light sound like they played and to recognize where I need to go.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. So, what other sounds did you hear? Do you remember?

[Speaker 1]
Hip-hop. Yeah, hip-hop. Yeah.

And also for the park and the children. The park, sorry.

[Speaker 2]
So, how do you compare whatever you heard in VR with that of a real city?

[Speaker 1]
Because I think it's really close to our life.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
So, it's the same thing. So, I don't know if this example is working or not. If you, every day you wash your hands, you use the water like drink it or just have a shower.

So, you can recognize it's a water sound. I think it's the same thing for I do the task. I heard like whatever the traffic lights or the vehicle sound or the construction sound.

It's really reality with our real life from the test.

[Speaker 2]
So, I found similarity between.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
So, can you explain me how did you decide when you were doing the second and third task? The road crossing and the scavenger hunt when you were doing that task. Can you explain how you were making decisions about where to go and how to go?

[Speaker 1]
Actually, I'm only slicing from the headphone where I heard the sound from. From my left hand or the central, sorry, my left or right or the center. And so that I can walk and to find the sound is really close me or a little bit far from me.

So, I can just change my way to close the sound.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. So, the distance between you and the source of sound helped you to make decisions?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. So, like how would you have done the task without visuals that you did? Okay.

Like how would your decisions change if you had to do it with seeing? With seeing?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Oh, that means I cannot look, right?

[Speaker 2]
So, you can hear, you can see what is in front of you. So, if you were to do the same tasks two and three with visuals, how would your decision making change?

[Speaker 1]
So, I think it's really different with the new version. Like if I can watch everything from here, it's the first time like you gave me the task from the two or three, I think for find the hot dog or the bus station. So, first time if I can watch everything, I will not listen.

I am not use my ear to hear something. I will like find a way from the screen. Okay.

Yeah, first. So, I think that is a difference. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
If I can watch, I will look first. But if I cannot watch everything, I will use my ear to hear. Okay.

Got it.

[Speaker 2]
So, for the first task that you did to distinguish between textures. So, apart from what you've heard in through the cane and like felt through the cane and heard through the headphones, did you also hear any external sound? External sound like when the actual, the real cane was touching the base?

Did you hear or feel anything?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it's different because I'm not really good to recognize separate every different type of the floor. But I think it's from the viewing of the tours, it can feeling is different.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Yeah. Okay.

So, did like, did you feel and hear any other sounds like apart from the game sound and game vibration? No. Nothing?

Yeah, nothing.

[Speaker 1]
Because you give me enough time to feeling, I think it's a five total different floor. Yeah, I think that's it. I don't feel like another sound.

Alright.

[Speaker 2]
So, how do you think the vibration of the textures were to real life?

[Speaker 1]
Because I am not using it before. So, it's a little bit hard for me because we talked before like, if I'm in blind right now, I think a little bit hard for me to use it right right now like to do that and use it. Because it's a different with use my eyes and use my ear to recognize a way or something from our world.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. So, but like, how real do you think the vibrations were? It's really real.

Okay.

[Speaker 1]
I mean, how should I recognize it is not how Luke really similar like our real world but it's just a simulation. I think it's a really close our life. Okay.

Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. So, for doing task one, you did the task with audio and haptics, the vibration. You did the task with only audio.

And then you did the task with only haptics, three different versions. So, do you think if you had to choose between those three, what would you choose? Um, it depends.

[Speaker 1]
If for this time, because I can watch everything. So, I will choose the first first one. Audio and haptics.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
But but if for some people, the accessible, maybe I will choose a second one.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
But the third one, I'm really honestly, it's really hard for me. If I only use the tools, I cannot hear everything. I cannot watch.

It's really hard.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. All right. Sure.

So, for task two and three, which you do, which you did the road crossing and finding the sound sources scavenger hunt. Like how would you compare your experiences? So, you did it with visuals and without visuals.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
So, if you had to compare that experience, how would you explain it?

[Speaker 1]
Um, like with talks of water, it's the same thing. Like, um, why is we use our eyes first? If we can watch something from the world, real world or the task that we need you, we must use our eyes first.

But if we cover our eyes, we cannot watch everything. We will use the second for our ear, like to hear something. So, sound is the most important thing.

But if we have a truth for both of that, we will, I think for me, I will use my eyes first. Yeah. Not my, my ear to hear the sound.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. So, doing task two and three, did you find any problem? If what were there any problem that you encountered?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, yeah, uh, that is interesting because, uh, well, well, I, when I can watch everything for here to find the road, uh, I think the really funny thing is, is, um, it's really different with, um, we make a turn, like what, whatever, like a U-turn or turn left or turn right and go straight. It's different with, uh, when we cover our eyes.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. It's, I think the logic for me is really different because for, if I can watch everything and I even don't use my ear to hurt the sound, I can do the right to turn. But if I cannot, uh, watch everything from the, from the screen or the word I need to use my ear to separate where I need to go.

And, but after I finished her, I don't know is that I successful turn to the right way or not. Yeah. So it's different.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. So do you think there were any benefits to performing these tasks without visuals? Uh, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Yeah. I think, uh, this give me the real feeling, uh, it's a really close our life.

Yeah. And I think it's a really good simulation. I also, I think it can help some accessible people.

Yeah. In the real life.

[Speaker 2]
So if you had to do this experiment in real life, would you be able to do it?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Why not?

[Speaker 2]
Without, without seeing anything?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, it's a little bit hard, but, but if, I mean, if I'm really blind in the future, no, like, like for example, right now, if I put on the blindfold, right.

[Speaker 2]
Then I tell you across the road or, you know, find something like this, would you be able to do it?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I can try it, but maybe a little bit dangerous. Why do you think it's dangerous? Cause if like, from the task, I use a cover from my eyes, uh, when I cross the road, I can't hear any sound from the vehicle.

Right. And also from the, uh, the cabs vehicle. Um, but it will light people feeling nervous.

Um, so, but I know it's a task, so I'm not really nervous, but if I'm in real world, I will feel like, is that a, uh, a real car crash me when I'm across the road.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Yeah. So, okay.

So you're saying that you would be more aware and more careful.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Really carefully.

[Speaker 2]
So does that mean you were less careful in while doing this experiment?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. I'm feeling relaxed. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
You are not, you, you, you, we are not really careful. Yeah. Yeah.

Okay. So based on your experience, uh, do you think this will be useful for someone who has been blind just now, let's say like somebody who is not blind by birth, like somebody who would, who was able to see became visually impaired, became blind due to certain medical condition. And now they want to learn how to walk in the real life.

[Speaker 1]
Do you think this will help them to Yeah, I think it is across from the question near the same question. Like, do you think this is a really fast way for the people who never touched it before? Uh, the technical can really quick alert.

I think it is. Okay. Yeah.

It's for me, it's not really difficult to learn how to use it for like, for you introducing me how as a training section. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
So for task two and three that you did, uh, what was the role of the cane for you? The cane, the stick that you used, what was the role for you?

[Speaker 1]
If I'm, if I use a cover for my eyes, I cannot see anything. Uh, the tool can just give me the weaving. I use the touch feeling and also both the touch feeling and also the sound feeling from my ear to recognize where is the right way for me.

Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
So while doing task two and three, uh, because there were so many different kinds of sounds, did you forget about the cane?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, yeah, I'm honestly, uh, I think it is, but, um, for me, I just recognized, uh, if that has given me the back feeling for when I use the toes.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. But you did know that you had the cane and you had to use it, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. I can.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, what do you think, uh, what do you think about using the cane? Like if I had used, uh, let's say only a VR controller, right. Instead of the whole cane, would it, would it have affected the level of immersiveness in the game?

Would it change the level of immersiveness or realism in the game? What do you think?

[Speaker 1]
Um, I just confused that only work for, uh, when cover our eyes or not. It will work anytime.

[Speaker 2]
Anytime. I think. No, if like, answer it in terms of when you were, you were, when your eyes were closed.

[Speaker 1]
I think it's a, it's a useful, cause for any time we need, uh, like for this time, we, we will like catch something to get a feeling. I think that is a sensor from our hand. We can touch when we do the simulation, we can watch and we can get feeling from our hand, like to, to the toes.

Yeah. I think it is very useful. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. So what do you think about the slide? Do you think it, that it increases or decreases the level of immersion in the game?

What do you think? For sidewalk? The sidewalk, the sidewalk on which, sorry, the slide mill, I mean.

I think it's, it's good. So do you think it, uh, affected the, your level of immersion in the game? Do you know?

No, it's good.

[Speaker 1]
No.

[Speaker 2]
Did it positively affect it? Like, uh, did it, uh, affect, uh, I mean, using the slide, did you feel you were like really in the city? Yeah.

Did it make you feel that?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it's really close with the real life. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
So how did you find it different from walking, natural walking?

[Speaker 1]
Um, you mean from the real walking? The real life walking. Uh, for this one, it's just cause I had something from my back.

Okay. Uh, when I make a turn, it's just a little bit late, uh, when I make a turn.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
But I think that another thing is the same. Okay. I don't think there's some difference with it.

Okay. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
So what do you think about the platform that is around the slide mill? How, how do you think it helped you in the game?

[Speaker 1]
Um, it's just give me, um, how to say, make me feel more safety. I can touch with something cause when we do the task with a VR, AR, the most things if we can watch it's a screen, right? So I think that the platform give me another feedback from the, the feeling.

Okay. Yeah. Exactly.

For the watching things, I can feeling, gather feedback for the, like the touch. Okay. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Uh, so what do you think, how, uh, how real would this system be for someone with visual impairment who are blind? How effective would this be with this whole system be for someone who is blind? Accessible people, you mean?

Yeah. Blind people who cannot see, real life blind people.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. I think it's useful if the, uh, pass the training.

[Speaker 2]
I mean, okay. Yeah. So you think it will be, uh, it will be really enough for people who cannot see?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, I think it is. I mean, it must, it will be like update later, right? For the version of the, this technique.

But I think it's, it can help the blind people. Yeah. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
So did this experiment change your, uh, level of empathy or awareness toward people who are blind? Do you have feeling towards blind people? I don't know.

Maybe.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Tell me like your level of respect or your level of awareness or level of sympathy, empathy for blind people. Yeah. Do you think you are more aware about them?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Can you explain how you are more aware?

[Speaker 1]
Um, cause it, it can help them, I think. Yeah. So, but for me, I am really hard.

I see, I don't know. Cause, um, even I take part in this task, I use a cover for the mask, but I'm not really blind. So some experience and feeling for me is not really a reality with them.

But I, I mean, it is really closely, but it's not, so I'm not really a hundred percent, like the confidence is really available. But I, if you ask me like mandatory, I'm obviously, it's really helpful for there. Yeah.

Cause they get really good as a, whatever use the toes or listen, heard some song from our life. They are more experienced than me. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. So what is your overall feedback on the system?

[Speaker 1]
Um, I think it's, uh, give me, um, a new feeling for, for that. And like the last question you asked me is I, I think it's really helpful. Some accessibility people.

Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. So do you think anything needs to be improved on in this system?

[Speaker 1]
Um, yeah, like, so it's not really important, but I think it is from the screens, uh, the image, what do we look from the screen? Um, we can, if, if we can, can make it more of fluency. Yeah.

Sometime it would be like, when I work, it would be stuck and it just arrived to the new way. Yeah. But it's another way.

I think it's a, it's good. Yeah. So that's the end of the interview.

Thank you.
